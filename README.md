<br><b>Step 6: This screen is the ticket information dialog. Here you can leave comments and assign it to personell. SLA is Service Level Agreement. In a contract with customers there is criteria that is required to respond back to customers. When you assign it's important to be aware who is who in your organization so that the ticket gets resolved as fast as possible. This would be reasonable to be set to John Smith who is System Administrator because John then can add Josh Morgan to AD and get his workstation setup.
